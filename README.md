Welcome to my portfolio!

Uncovering the Stats Behind the Spokes is my final project for my Statistical Data Analysis class. My partners and I cleaned and analyzed two years of bike share data from https://vitalflux.com/linear-regression-datasets-csv-excel/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#google_vignette, fit a second order linear regression model with 11 predictors to forecast daily bike usage.

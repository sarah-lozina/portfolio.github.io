# üß™ BCA Code
*Project done in free time to simplify and expedite data analysis time while interning at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute*

The **Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) Assay** is a colorimetric technique used to quantify protein concentrations in cell lysates and purified protein samples. Normalizing these concentrations, based on the lowest detected value (ng/¬µL), is essential to ensure equal protein loading during western blotting to have accurate and reproducible results.

Previously, this normalization process was performed manually using Excel, which was both time-consuming and confusing. To streamline the workflow, I developed a **Python script** that automates the entire process.

# üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Uncovering the Stats Behind the Spokes  
*Final Project ‚Äì Statistical Data Analysis*

My teammates and I analyzed two years of bike share [data](https://vitalflux.com/linear-regression-datasets-csv-excel/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#google_vignette). We cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, then built a **second-order linear regression model** with **11 predictors** to forecast daily bike rental counts.

# ü´Ü Exploring Patterns in Manslaughter: The Influence of Location, Time, and Demographics
*[Final Project](https://public.tableau.com/shared/ZKTGJY5KQ?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) - Data Visualization*

My teammates and I analyzed US crime records from 1980-2016 of murder, manslaughter, and manslaughter by negligence. The goal of our project was to examine how manslaughter/murder cases exhibit variations based on several key elements, such as location, year, and demographic information. Throughout our visualizations, we aim to present trends which may not be obvious and explore what might possibly be causing these patterns. After cleaning the data, we created four interactive visualizations using Tableau to display trends.
